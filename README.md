# ntrcardhax-tools
Repository of tools developed for exploiting ntrcardhax.

Currently all that's here is a concept for the 3ds tool for assisting with exploiting ntrcardhax. This isn't useful if you don't have a useful payload in the header of your gamecard.

This assistant homebrew probably isn't even useful, as it was written as my first homebrew. Horrible, isn't it?

## TODO
* Test the homebrew and make it actually work.
* Have a payload that will be useful.
* Bring over all of the information that is currently in my [gist](https://gist.github.com/kitling/e6e03b5f26f9c6b50515) about ntrcardhax.
